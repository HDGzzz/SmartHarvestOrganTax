# Rimworld mod:SmartHarvestOrganTax
    ver:0.1
Adds a command that allows you to harvest organs from prisoners with a single, intelligent action.
    Simply drag to select the prisoners, and all surgery bills will be automatically queued, along with medical care settings and restrictions adjusted accordingly.
    You can customize the priority of which side’s organs (left or right) to harvest first, as well as the medical care level used, in the mod settings.

添加了一个命令:
    用于一键且智能的收获俘虏的器官,只需用这个命令框选俘虏,接下来所有手术清单的添加,更改医疗限制都将自动完成。
    可在设置中更改优先摘取器官的优先级与医药限制
